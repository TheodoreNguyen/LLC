This repository contains my and my team's working directory for the final project 
done in the class Math 191 - Numerical Linear Algebra for Data Analysis, taken Winter 2016
at UCLA. The purpose of the project was to write a linear algebra based algorithm written in
an academic paper in python. This project was worked on by Theodore Nguyen, Eric Fornaciari, 
and Chris Jeon. This is my personal repository for the project - the team contributions can
be found at https://github.com/efornaciari/LLC

Also note that all MATLAB code in the repository is the property of the writers of the academic
paper: Locality-constrained Linear Coding for Image Classification. The paper can be found 
with a quick Google search, or at http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~jyang29/papers/CVPR10-LLC.pdf
